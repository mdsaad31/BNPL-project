## ✦ What is NexaPay?

> **The first non-custodial Buy Now Pay Later protocol on BNB Chain.**

NexaPay lets users split on-chain purchases into **4 weekly installments** while merchants receive **instant payment**. Collateral is locked at 150% in a decentralized vault — no intermediaries, no credit checks, no banks.

Users can also **borrow BNB against their NFTs** (50% LTV, 5% interest, 30-day terms) and build an **on-chain credit reputation** through the Aura Score system.

---

## ✦ Value Proposition

| For Buyers | For Merchants | For the Ecosystem |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Split payments into 4 weeks | Get paid instantly at purchase | Non-custodial — funds never sit in a multisig |
| No credit checks, no KYC | Zero chargeback risk | On-chain transparency for every transaction |
| Earn "Aura" credit score | On-chain sales dashboard | Composable DeFi primitive on BNB Chain |
| Borrow BNB against NFTs | Automatic installment tracking | Dockerized for reproducible demos |

---

## ✦ Target Users

| Persona | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **🛒 Crypto-Native Shoppers** | DeFi users who want structured spending without selling assets |
| **🏪 Web3 Merchants** | Stores/DAOs that want instant settlement with zero fraud risk |

## ✦ Aura — On-Chain Credit Score

Every wallet builds a **reputation score (0–1000)** from 6 weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Repayment Reliability | 40% | On-time payments vs. defaults |
| Payment Discipline | 25% | Early/on-time vs. late payments |
| Borrowing Experience | 15% | Total loan history depth |
| Portfolio Diversity | 8% | Mix of BNPL + NFT loans |
| Collateral Behavior | 6% | Proper collateral claims |
| NFT Lending Record | 6% | NFT loan repayment history |

| Tier | Score Range | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🌟 Legendary | 850–1000 | Gold standard of DeFi trust |
| 💜 Strong | 700–849 | Excellent track record |
| 📈 Rising | 550–699 | Building solid reputation |
| ⚪ Neutral | 400–549 | Average — room to grow |
| 🔺 Weak | 200–399 | Concerning patterns |
| ⚡ Broken | 0–199 | Major trust issues |

> Aura is **100% frontend-computed** from on-chain data. No oracle, no centralized server.

---

## ✦ Business Model

NexaPay captures value at **every stage of the lending lifecycle** without relying on a governance token.

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Mechanism | When |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **BNPL Protocol Fee** | 1–2% service fee on each installment purchase | Every purchase |
| **NFT Lending Interest** | 5% flat interest on NFT-backed BNB loans | Every NFT loan |
| **Liquidation Surplus** | Collateral exceeding outstanding debt is retained by the treasury on defaults | On default events |
| **Treasury Yield** | Protocol treasury funds deployed to BNB Chain yield strategies (Venus, Alpaca) during idle periods | Continuous |
| **Aura-Tiered Pricing** | High Aura wallets (700+) unlock reduced collateral ratios (down to 120%), driving repeat usage | Repeat borrowers |
| **Merchant Integration API** | Paid API access for Web3 merchants and dApps to embed NexaPay checkout | B2B partnerships |
| **Cross-Chain Bridge Fees** | Toll on cross-chain BNPL transactions via LayerZero/Wormhole (Phase 3) | Future expansion |

### Unit Economics

```
Per 1 BNB BNPL Purchase:
  Protocol fee (1.5%)          = 0.015 BNB
  Treasury holds 1.5 BNB collateral during loan term
  If default → surplus captured (up to 0.5 BNB after debt coverage)

Per 1 BNB NFT Loan:
  Interest income (5%)         = 0.05 BNB
  If default → NFT liquidation value captured
```

### Growth Flywheel

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Low-Fee BNPL] --> B[More Buyers]
    B --> C[More Merchants]
    C --> D[More Products]
    D --> A
    B --> E[Higher Aura Scores]
    E --> F[Better Loan Terms]
    F --> B
    C --> G[Treasury Growth]
    G --> H[More NFT Lending Capacity]
    H --> B
```

> No governance token at this stage. Revenue is **protocol-native** — earned through service fees, interest, and treasury management, not token inflation.

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/mdsaad31/BNPL-project.git
cd BNPL-project

# 2. Contracts
cd contracts && npm install
npx hardhat node                    # Terminal 1
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost  # Terminal 2

# 3. Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install
npm run dev                         # → http://localhost:5173
```

### Option C: BSC Testnet (Live)

Contracts are already deployed. Just:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Connect MetaMask to **BSC Testnet** (Chain ID 97) and get test BNB from the [BNB Faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart).

## ✦ Demo Flows

### 🛒 BNPL Purchase

1. Connect wallet → Browse `/shop` → Select product
2. Confirm purchase → 1.5× collateral locked in vault → Merchant paid instantly
3. Visit `/dashboard` → Pay 4 weekly installments → Collateral released

### 🎨 NFT Lending

1. Go to `/nft-loans` → Mint a demo NFT
2. Deposit BNB into NFT treasury → Borrow against your NFT (50% LTV)
3. Repay loan + 5% interest within 30 days → NFT returned

### ⚡ Default & Liquidation

1. Purchase a product → Use Dev Panel (bottom-right gear icon) to fast-forward time
2. Let grace period expire → Trigger default on dashboard
3. Collateral liquidated: outstanding debt to treasury, remainder refunded

### 🌟 Aura Score

1. Connect wallet → Visit `/aura`
2. View your real-time credit score computed from all on-chain activity
3. See factor breakdowns, tier badge, improvement tips

```

**20 tests** covering:

- ✅ Collateral math (1.5× constraints)
- ✅ Merchant registration & product CRUD
- ✅ Purchase flow with collateral locking
- ✅ Installment payments
- ✅ Full repayment with collateral release
- ✅ Default/liquidation with correct fund distribution
